## Understanding Food Insecurity

Food insecurity is a significant global challenge, with millions of people lacking access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. Through this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of the root causes of food insecurity, such as poverty, unemployment, climate change, natural disasters, limited resources, and conflict. By gaining insights into these causes, we can work towards finding effective solutions.
